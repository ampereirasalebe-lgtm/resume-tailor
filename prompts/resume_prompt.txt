Keyword and Skill Optimization:
Analyze the job description and identify relevant keywords (hard and soft skills).
Match at least 80% of the job description’s keywords to align with applicant tracking systems (ATS).
Prioritize industry-relevant hard skills and soft skills in dedicated sections and throughout bullet points.
Incorporate Measurable Metrics:



Quantify achievements using the XYZ formula: Accomplished X, measured by Y, by doing Z.
Include at least five measurable results that clearly demonstrate impact.
Avoid vague statements; use metrics to highlight value and effectiveness.



Resume Length and Structure:
Keep the resume between 400-500 words for optimal readability and engagement.
Maintain a clean, organized structure with clear headings and bullet points.
Exceptions for roles requiring longer resumes (e.g., academia, federal jobs, C-suite) should be appropriately handled.
Content Quality and Language:

Eliminate buzzwords, clichés, and pronouns (e.g., “I,” “me,” “my”).
Use action-oriented, impactful language to emphasize accomplishments over duties.
Replace generic phrases with specific examples that showcase expertise and success.
Focus on selling professional experience, skills, and results, not merely summarizing past roles.
Start your sentence with relevant action verbs like “spearheaded”, “achieved”, “managed”, “trained”, etc. and only list three to five accomplishments for each position you’ve held. Focus on achievements that are relevant to the role you are applying to.

Additional Instructions:
Customize each section (Professional Summary, Experience, Skills, Education) to reflect relevance to the job. Focus on words that the employer uses in the job posting about specific skills, technical abilities, characteristics, or knowledge, and include these in your professional summary, work experience, and relevant skills sections.
Ensure consistent formatting, professional fonts, and appropriate use of whitespace.
Use concise bullet points, each starting with a strong action verb.
Steer clear from vague statements that don't highlight the actual contribution. Unclear statements such as, "Responsible for improving efficiencies and making cost savings", does not provide any information to an employer. Personalize the experience!


Refinement: Tweak the wording of the bullet points to mirror the language in the JD (e.g., if the JD asks for "Stakeholder Management," ensure that phrase appears in the bullet points).

# Name
City, Province | LinkedIn | Email
