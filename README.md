# resume-tailor

Python project to tailor resumes and cover letters.

Quick start

1. Create a virtual environment and install dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Initialize git (already done locally) and add a remote:

```bash
git remote add origin <your-remote-url>
git push -u origin main
```

Files of interest: `app/` contains the application code and `prompts/` holds prompts.
